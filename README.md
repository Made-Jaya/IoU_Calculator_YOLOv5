# IoU_Calculator_YOLOv5


According to the experimental results, it can be concluded that the use of IOU can solve the error caused by the occlusion between the illumination and the target during the target tracking process.When the target is occluded or exposed to light, an obstruction is detected or nothing is
detected. That is, the original target is not detected, and it is assumed that the occlusion is associated with the original target.Then, after the occlusion or illumination ends, because the target IOUs of similar size tend to be large, the correct association can be quickly restored.
